# WeatherAPP

Simple static weather web app (HTML/CSS/JS) that uses Open-Meteo for forecasts and Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) for geocoding â€” both are free and require no API key for basic usage.

Features:

- Search by place name
- Use browser geolocation (with permission)
- Current weather + 7-day forecast
- Save favorites (localStorage)
- Toggle Celsius / Fahrenheit
- Responsive, modern UI

- Professional polished UI with brand header and refined layout


How to run

1. Open `d:/WeatherAPP/index.html` in your browser (double-click or use Live Server).
2. Type a place name and press Enter or click Search.
3. Or click "Use my location" and allow geolocation.

Notes

- This app calls public services (Open-Meteo and Nominatim). For heavy production traffic, get proper API access and follow usage policies.
